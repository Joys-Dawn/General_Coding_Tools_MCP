# MCP server

This directory is the General Coding Tools MCP server. The [root README](../README.md) describes each skill and subagent and how to use the server.

**Build:** `npm install && npm run build`  
**Run:** `npm start` or `node dist/index.js`

Content lives in `skills/` and `subagents/` and is bundled into `dist/content.json` at build time.
