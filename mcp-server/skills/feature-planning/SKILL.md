# Feature Planning

Enter plan mode and produce a thorough, implementation-ready feature plan. Do not write any code until the plan is approved.

## Trigger

When this skill is invoked, **immediately enter plan mode** using the EnterPlanMode tool. All planning work happens inside plan mode.

## Scope

- **User describes a feature**: Treat the description as the starting point. Explore the codebase to understand where the feature fits before designing anything.
- **Request is vague or ambiguous**: Ask clarifying questions using AskUserQuestion before proceeding. Do not assume intent. Common ambiguities to probe:
  - Who is the target user or actor?
  - What is the expected behavior vs. current behavior?
  - Are there constraints (performance, compatibility, platform)?
  - What is explicitly out of scope?
  - Are there related features this interacts with?
- **User provides a detailed spec**: Validate it against the codebase. Identify gaps, contradictions, or unstated assumptions and raise them before planning.

Do NOT skip clarification. A plan built on wrong assumptions wastes more time than a question.

## Process

### 1. Understand Context

- Read the project's SPEC.md, README, CLAUDE.md, and any relevant docs to understand the system's architecture, conventions, and existing features.
- Explore the codebase areas the feature will touch. Identify existing patterns, data models, state management, and UI conventions.
- Map out what already exists that the feature will interact with or depend on.
- Output: A brief summary of the current system context relevant to this feature.

### 2. Clarify Requirements

- If any of the following are unclear, ask before continuing:
  - **Functional requirements**: What exactly should the feature do? What are the inputs, outputs, and user flows?
  - **Non-functional requirements**: Performance targets, data volume expectations, offline behavior, accessibility.
  - **Boundaries**: What is in scope vs. out of scope for this iteration?
  - **Dependencies**: Does this require new APIs, services, migrations, or third-party integrations?
- Output: A clear, numbered list of confirmed requirements.

### 3. Design the Feature

Produce a plan that covers each of the following sections. Skip a section only if it genuinely does not apply.

#### 3a. User-Facing Behavior
- Describe the feature from the user's perspective: what they see, what they do, what happens.
- Cover the happy path end-to-end.
- Define error states and what the user sees when things go wrong (invalid input, network failure, permission denied, etc.).

#### 3b. Data Model Changes
- New types, interfaces, database tables, or schema changes.
- Migrations needed and their reversibility.
- Impact on existing data (backwards compatibility, data backfill).

#### 3c. Architecture & Module Design
- Which files/modules will be created or modified.
- How the feature integrates with the existing architecture (state management, routing, API layer, etc.).
- Clear responsibility boundaries: what each new module/function owns.

#### 3d. API & Integration Points
- New endpoints, webhooks, or external service calls.
- Request/response shapes.
- Authentication and authorization requirements.

#### 3e. State Management
- What state the feature introduces (local, global, persisted, cached).
- State transitions and lifecycle.
- How state syncs across components or with the backend.

#### 3f. Implementation Steps
- An ordered sequence of concrete implementation steps.
- Each step should be small enough to be a single commit.
- Note dependencies between steps (what must come before what).
- Identify which steps can be done in parallel.

### 4. Analyze Quality Dimensions

Proactively evaluate the proposed design against each of these dimensions. For each, explicitly state what risks exist and how the design addresses them. If a dimension does not apply, say so briefly. See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for named standards, plan quality criteria, templates, and anti-patterns.

#### Bugs & Correctness
*(Applies `correctness-audit` — Dimensions 1–9: Logic Bugs through Concurrency & Shared State)*

Review the design against the `correctness-audit` dimensions. State which are highest-risk for this feature:
- **Logic bugs**: off-by-one errors, boolean inversions, wrong operators in proposed conditional logic
- **Null / undefined**: fields that can be absent — are they guarded? Do nullable DB columns match their TypeScript types?
- **Async & Promise**: are concurrent async paths safe? Is there risk of fire-and-forget on critical writes?
- **Concurrency / TOCTOU**: can concurrent requests (multiple users, tabs, or duplicate submissions) corrupt shared state? Does any step read-check-act on data another operation could change between check and act?

#### Edge Cases
*(Applies `correctness-audit` — Dimensions 7 & 8: Edge Case Inputs, External Data & Network)*

- **Empty state**: what does the user see before any data exists for this feature?
- **Boundary values**: max field lengths, max collection sizes, numeric overflow — are they defined and enforced at both the API and database layers?
- **Network failures**: if an operation fails mid-way, what state is the system left in? Is partial completion visible to the user?
- **Reentrant / concurrent usage**: double-submit, multiple tabs, back-button navigation mid-flow.
- **External data**: any third-party API or webhook payload — is it validated as `unknown` before use, not cast directly to a typed shape?

#### Design Quality
*(SOLID — Robert C. Martin; Clean Architecture — Robert C. Martin & Martin Fowler)*

- **SRP**: does each new module have one clearly stated reason to change?
- **OCP**: can new behavior be added by extension without modifying existing modules?
- **DIP**: do high-level modules depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations?
- **Dependency direction**: do dependencies point inward (domain ← application ← infrastructure)? No domain module should depend on a framework or I/O layer.
- Does the design follow existing project patterns, or introduce a new one? If new, is the justification explicitly stated?

#### Maintainability
*(Clean Code — Robert C. Martin; The Pragmatic Programmer — Hunt & Thomas)*

- Will a developer unfamiliar with this feature understand it from the plan alone, without asking the author?
- Are proposed module and function names self-documenting?
- Are non-obvious design decisions explained in the plan's rationale, not left as tribal knowledge?
- Are implicit contracts between modules made explicit (typed interfaces, documented invariants)?

#### Modularity
*(SOLID — SRP, ISP, DIP; UNIX philosophy)*

- Can each new component be unit-tested in isolation, without the full stack?
- Are new module dependencies unidirectional? Does the design introduce any circular imports?
- Could any new module be replaced or reused independently of the others?

#### Simplicity
*(KISS — Clarence Johnson, 1960; YAGNI — Extreme Programming, Kent Beck & Ron Jeffries)*

- **KISS**: is this the simplest design that satisfies the stated requirements?
- **YAGNI**: are there components designed for hypothetical future requirements not in scope for this iteration?
- Does the language or framework already provide something the design is building from scratch?
- Is there unnecessary indirection — interfaces, factories, registries — with only one concrete implementation?

#### Scalability
*(Applies `correctness-audit` — Dimensions 10–12: Algorithmic Complexity, Database & I/O, Memory & Throughput)*

- Will this design function correctly at 10× the current data volume without architectural changes?
- Are there unbounded database queries (no `LIMIT`) or full-collection loads into memory?
- Are there N+1 query patterns that will emerge as data grows?
- Is any coordination state stored in-memory in a way that breaks under horizontal scale-out?

#### Security
*(Applies `security-audit` — use the relevant domains for each new design element)*

Map each new element of the design to the applicable security-audit domains:
- **New API endpoint** → §2 Authorization, §5 Input Validation, §6 API Security, §8 Rate Limiting
- **New database table or function** → §7 Database Security (RLS, REVOKE, CHECK constraints)
- **New auth flow or session handling** → §1 Authentication & Session Management
- **New external service call or webhook** → §6 API7 SSRF, §10 webhook deduplication & signature
- **New financial operation** → §10 Financial & Transaction Integrity, §9 Concurrency & Race Conditions
- **New user data stored or transmitted** → §13 Data Privacy & Retention, §4 Cryptography & Secrets

### 5. Identify Risks & Open Questions

- List anything that could go wrong or that you're uncertain about.
- Flag technical risks (performance cliffs, migration dangers, dependency on unstable APIs).
- Flag product risks (user confusion, feature conflicts, scope creep).
- For each risk, suggest a mitigation or note that it needs a decision.

## Rules

- **Plan mode first**: Always enter plan mode before doing any planning work. The plan is written to the plan file, not output as chat.
- **No code**: Do not write implementation code during planning. The plan is the deliverable.
- **Ask, don't assume**: If the request is ambiguous, ask clarifying questions. Prefer one round of good questions over multiple rounds of back-and-forth.
- **Read before designing**: Explore the codebase thoroughly. Reference actual file paths, function names, and patterns from the project.
- **Be concrete**: Implementation steps should reference specific files and modules, not vague descriptions like "update the backend."
- **Be honest about uncertainty**: If you're unsure about something, flag it as an open question rather than making a guess that will become the plan.
- **Respect existing patterns**: The plan should extend the project's architecture, not fight it. If a new pattern is warranted, justify why.
- **Scope boundaries**: Clearly state what is and isn't included. Prevent scope creep by naming it.
- **Name the pattern**: when the design follows or introduces a named pattern (Repository, Strategy, ADR, C4 Container), name it and note its source so the rationale is traceable.
- **Delegate to audit skills**: the quality analysis does not re-describe what the audit skills cover in detail — it identifies which domains apply and defers to those skills for the specific checklist.
